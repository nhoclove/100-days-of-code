## Day 8: Jan 07. Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Implemented Song service using gRPC

**Thoughts**: The more you try the more you make mistakes and the more you learn and grow.

**Notes**: gRPC does not allow registering two services with the same name and package name.

**Link to work**: [gRPC for song](https://github.com/nhoclove/microservices/commit/797c5a874d01c677047e63c0b32012edbb75c376)

## Day 9: Jan 08. Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Completely implemented gRPC service clients for Singer and Song services.

**Thoughts**: Felt out of inspiration in the beginning but gained it back when put my phone down and started coding. According to <em>thinking fast and slow</em> book, my system 2 won this time :)
