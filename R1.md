## Day 8: Jan 07. Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Implemented Song service using gRPC

**Thoughts**: The more you try the more you make mistakes and the more you learn and grow.

**Notes**: gRPC does not allow registering two services with the same name and package name.

**Link to work**: [gRPC for song](https://github.com/nhoclove/microservices/commit/797c5a874d01c677047e63c0b32012edbb75c376)

## Day 9: Jan 08. Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Completely implemented gRPC service clients for Singer and Song services.

**Thoughts**: Felt out of inspiration in the beginning but gained it back when put my phone down and started coding. According to <em>thinking fast and slow</em> book, my system 2 won this time :)

**Link to work**: [grpc service client](https://github.com/nhoclove/microservices/commit/d5a68ed45e4ae378af92295a612c3a72e9c1dc77)

## Day 10: Jan 09. Thursday
**Today's Progress**: I added UT for Song service but not finished yet

**Thoughts**: Having some difficulties with the accessibility òf interfaces. When an interface ís not exported then generating mock for it will end up not import that interface's mock in test file. Because that interface is not exported.
There are two options available for me, the first one is to change the accessibility of interface to <em>exported</em> or second, try to figure out how to generate mocked interfaces with export accessibility.

## Day 11: Jan 11 Saturday. 
**Today's Progress**: Today I added more UT for song service.

**Thoughts**: Achieving 80% test coverage is not easy as I thought.

**Notes**: When we can not write UT for our modules/services, that's the sign of a weak, not properly design.

## Day 12: Jan 12 Sunday. 
**Today's Progress**: Added more test cases to get better test coverage but have not reach my target of 80%.

**Thoughts**: Felt a little bit lazy and unmotivated to work on sunday :(

**Notes**:
- How internal package works in go and how to generate mocks for packages reside in internal package ?
- How to generate mocks for unexported packages ?
- Route/path variables in httptest handler package.
- Propre package naming for UT.

**Link to work**: [Add mock service](https://github.com/nhoclove/microservices/commit/e6f83faaee21fc083c84e7e3f076b0e5c9840692)

## Day 13: Jan 13 Monday. 
**Today's Progress**: Added more UT to Song service

**Thoughts**: Some code blocks are difficult or impossible to test. It leaves me to decide whether I should
refactor the existing code to make it testable or forcibly write test for it. One of these is Repo code which is depending on external libraries (Mongo/Redis)

**Link to work**: [Continue adding UT](https://github.com/nhoclove/microservices/commit/6d35cfdc21999d0207554b8aaeb763250f586d45)

## Day 14: Jan 14 Tuesday. 
**Today's Progress**: I added more UT to song service but could not reach 80% coverage

**Thoughts**: Need to delve into a technique called mocking third party dependencies with interface and DI.

**Link to work**: [Adding UT](https://github.com/nhoclove/microservices/commit/109e468e47fca72d18b9624c6d98493a034339ed)

## Day 15: Jan 15 Wednesday. 
**Today's Progress**: I tried to mock Redis for getting more test coverage but could not successfully do it.

**Thoughts**: It's pretty hard to mock third party dependencies because sometimes these libraries use their own types not the primitive types, it makes our service depend on these specific types.

## Day 17: Jan 21 Tuesday. 
**Today's Progress**: I tried to add more UT to song service but it did not work.

**Thoughts**: It's pretty interesting to know the new term *test pyramid*.

**Need to do**:
- Best practices for writing unit test.
- How test coverage is counted?

## Day 18: Jan 22 Wednesday. 
**Today's Progress**: I tried to add more UT to Song service, unfortunately redismock lib does not support redisv7 client.Leaving me two options
1. Contribute to the current project(redismock) to support redisv7 client.
2. Build my own redis mock lib from scratch.

**Thoughts**: I'm inclined to the first option which is contribute to the existing lib cause building things from scratch takes time and effort.

## Day 20: Feb 10 Monday. 
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned an amazing technique in Angular(Data Binding).
- For output data from **TypeScript** to **Template HTML** Angular supports two techniques:
  - String interpolation
  - Property binding
- For reacting to User events from **Template HTML** to **TypeScript** Event binding is a great way

**Thoughts**: During the course I encountered serveral issues but thanks to the great communities on the internet
I was able overcome them all.

## Day 21: Feb 11 Tuesday. 
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned a really great feature of Angular which is Directives. In my own opini
on, Directives have reduced our work a lot when It comes to working with the DOM.
**Thoughts**: In the bedinning of the course I did not recognize the value of Angular, but gradually I find myself in love
with Angular :)

## Day 22: Feb 12 Wednesday. 
**Today's Progress**: Today I setup my first Angular app with the guidance of my tutor. With all these setup I know
how to plan and divide an app into components in Angular.

**Thoughts**: Dividing an app into components is not as easy as I thought :(

**Today's Progress**: Today I add recipe and shopping list components to my Angular demo app.

**Thoughts**: String interpolation and proprety binding are amazing :)
